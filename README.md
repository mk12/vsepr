# VSEPR

VSEPR theory is a model used in chemistry to predict the shapes of molecules. It stands for _valence shell electron pair repulsion_. Electron pairs (bonded pairs as well as lone pairs) arrange themselves so as to minimize the total electrostatic repulsion.

This Processing sketch simulates the positions and velocities of electron pairs and applies an inverse-square repulsion force between every two pairs. The simulation quickly stabilizes to the correct molecule shape. The program draws the central atom and bonded atoms as spheres in a three-dimensional scene with superimposed bond angles.

## Usage

Open and run the sketch in [Processing](http://www.processing.org). Use the **up**/**down** arrow keys to change the number of bonded atoms. Rotate the camera with the **left**/**right** arrow keys. Toggle displaying the bond angles by pressing the **space bar**.
